    <p>Pumpkin bars are full of flavour with decadent cream cheese frosting. You'll love them!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 2/3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups of flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frosting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 package of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups sifted icing sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make cake: Beat pumpkin, sugar, oil, and eggs with an electric mixer in a medium bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into pumpkin mixture until thoroughly combined. Spread batter evenly into an ungreased 10x15-inch jelly roll pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cake bounces back when gently pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.</li>
        <li>While the cake is cooling, make frosting: Beat together butter and cream cheese until smooth; stir in vanilla. Add confectioners' sugar a little at a time, beating until mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread frosting evenly on top of cooled cake. Cut into 24 squares.</li>
    </ol>
